                In the current scenario people are often affected by mental health issues by different factors. 
As we can take example of covid-19 pandemic which has significant impact of mental health 
of people. The pandemic has led to increased stress, Anxiety and depression with many 
individualsâ€™ feelings of isolated fear and uncertainty. Along with that employees are affected 
by different parameters such as workload, gender, treatment, work interface etc. The research 
has shown that these mental health issues have affected people of all ages and backgrounds, 
with vulnerable populations such as healthcare workers, essential workers, and those with 
pre-existing mental health conditions being particularly affected. As a result, there has been 
an increased focus on mental health support and resources, with organizations and 
governments providing more services and programs to help individuals manage stress, 
anxiety, and depression.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict 
and manage mental health issues among employees in the workplace. Several studies have 
shown that ML algorithms can accurately identify individuals who are at risk of developing 
mental health problems and can provide insights into the factors that contribute to these 
issues. The use of ML in mental health prediction has the potential to improve the 
36
effectiveness of interventions and support services, and to reduce the stigma associated with 
mental health problems in the workplace. Based on our analysis of mental health issues 
among employees in the workplace using seven different algorithms, the gradient boosting 
classifier was found to perform the best with an accuracy of 0.806. On the other hand, the k 
nearest neighbor algorithm had a lower accuracy of 0.697. This suggests that the gradient 
boosting classifier may be a useful tool for predicting and managing mental health issues in 
the workplace. However, further research and validation may be necessary to confirm these 
findings and ensure the reliability of the predictive model.
